# Acoustic Panel Fabrication Project

This project presents the development of an eco-friendly acoustic panel made using recycled cloths and a custom-built semi-automatic machine.

## 🔧 My Contributions
- Developed a new composite material for acoustic absorption
- Designed and built a semi-automatic machine using pneumatic compression and 2000W heating coils
- Constructed a reflective test box for measuring sound absorption
- Applied principles of mechanical engineering to optimize bonding and uniform panel thickness
- Designed a mechanism to prevent clothes from adhering to the machine.
